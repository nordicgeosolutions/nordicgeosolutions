# I‚Äôm a Geographic Information Scientist working in the Spatial Humanities

I am a geographic information scientist employing innovative methods to understand space and place. My research focuses on applying Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to analyze testimonies of Holocaust survivors and rescuers. I am dedicated to understanding their perspectives of space and place, including mapping their emotional landscapes through advanced spatial interpolation techniques.
